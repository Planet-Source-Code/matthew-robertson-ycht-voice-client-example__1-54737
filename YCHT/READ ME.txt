this logs into ycht and conencts to chat and voice
this is the first time i done anything w/ voice, so it may not work that geat but it seems to work good
the yacsome library comes w/ yahoo messenger
i may make a ymsg and chat2 voice clients someday, or maby a general vox
ive been thinking about making a fully functional chat client like yahelite, if i do it will be open source :)


dont forget to give cridit!
